## Installation

This fork is supported across Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver). For full installation and upgrade
instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALL_SOURCE/)

### Hardware Requirements

InvokeAI is supported across Linux, Windows and macOS. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver).

#### System

You will need one of the following:

- An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory.
- An Apple computer with an M1 chip.

We do not recommend the GTX 1650 or 1660 series video cards. They are
unable to run in half-precision mode and do not have sufficient VRAM
to render 512x512 images.

#### Memory

- At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

#### Disk

- At least 12 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.
